              Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy,
              and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear
              ye the word of the LORD;
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that
              follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
            </p>
            <p>O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</p>
            <p>
              Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for
              the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
            </p>
            <p>
              They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD
              saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others
              to hope that they would confirm the word.
            </p>
            <p>
              Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
              divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not
              spoken?
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity,
              and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord
              GOD.
            </p>
            <p>
              And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that
              divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people,
              neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of
              Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye
              shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace;
              and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others
              daubed it with untempered morter:
            </p>
            <p>
              Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall
              fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great
              hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where
              is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a
              stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower
              in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.
            </p>
            <p>
              So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered
              morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation
              thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be
              consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the
              LORD.

              For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the
              LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is
              called by my name, to pollute it.
            </p>

              And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the
              valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their
              daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it
              into my heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no
              more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but
              the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there
              be no place.

              And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the

              Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
              streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of
              gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride:
              for the land shall be desolate.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of
              the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of
              the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the
              inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:
            </p>

              And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all
              the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have
              served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have
              sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered,
              nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.

              And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of
              them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the
              places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.
